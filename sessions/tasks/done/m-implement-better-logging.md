# Implement Better Logging System

## Problem/Goal

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Replace ad-hoc logging with structured logging system
- [ ] Implement proper log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) 
- [ ] Add contextual logging with request IDs and user context
- [ ] Configure log formatting for both development and production
- [ ] Add logging configuration via environment variables
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data (API keys, tokens) are not logged
