# Remove Claude Code Review from PRs

## Problem/Goal
Remove the current Claude Code Review / claude-review (pull_request) GitHub Action workflow. The automated code reviews are no longer needed and should be disabled to simplify the CI/CD pipeline.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Remove existing Claude Code Review GitHub Action workflow file
- [x] Clean up any related secrets or configuration (optional)
- [x] Verify PR workflow still works correctly without automated reviews
- [x] Test with a sample PR to ensure CI pipeline is unaffected

## Context Files
<!-- Added by context-gathering agent or manually -->
- .github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml - Main workflow file to remove
- .github/workflows/claude.yml - Interactive Claude workflow (keep this one)

## User Notes
Simply remove the automated Claude review from pull requests. Keep the repository clean and focused. The interactive Claude workflow can remain for manual assistance.
