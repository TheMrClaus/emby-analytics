# Implement Movie Stats Card

## Problem/Goal
Add a comprehensive "Movie Stats" card to the dashboard that displays key movie-related analytics and metadata. This will provide users with quick insights into their movie collection at a glance.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Create new backend API endpoint for movie statistics
- [x] Implement database queries for movie analytics
- [x] Design and build responsive Movie Stats card component
- [x] Display core statistics: Total Movies, Total Collections, Largest Movie (GB), Longest/Shortest Runtime, Newest Added
- [x] Add suggested additional metrics: Most Watched Movie, Total Runtime Hours, Popular Genres, Movies Added This Month
- [x] Integrate card into main dashboard layout
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and loading states
- [x] Test across different screen sizes and devices

## Enhanced Movie Stats Suggestions
**Core Metrics (Requested):**
- Total Movies
- Total Collections  
- Largest Movie (in GB)
- Longest Movie Runtime
- Shortest Movie Runtime
- Newest Added Movie

**Additional Valuable Metrics:**
- Most Watched Movie (by play count)
- Total Runtime Hours (sum of all movies)
- Popular Genres (top 3-5 genres by count)
- Movies Added This Month

## Context Files
<!-- Will be added by context-gathering agent -->

## User Notes
The card should follow the existing dashboard design patterns and be visually appealing with proper loading states. Both backend architect and frontend developer agents should be used for implementation - backend for API/database work, frontend for UI components and integration.
