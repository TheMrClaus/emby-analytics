Pre-Completion Checks\n     6→\n     7→Verify before proceeding:\n     8→- [ ] All success criteria checked off in task file\n     9→- [ ] No unaddressed work remaining\n    10→\n    11→**NOTE**: Do NOT commit yet - agents will modify files\n    12→\n    13→## 2. Run Completion Agents\n    14→\n    15→Delegate to specialized agents in this order:\n    16→```\n    17→1. code-review agent - Review all implemented code for security/quality\n    18→   Include: Changed files, task context, implementation approach\n    19→   \n    20→2. service-documentation agent - Update CLAUDE.md files \n    21→   Include: List of services modified during task\n    22→   \n    23→3. logging agent - Finalize task documentation\n    24→   Include: Task completion summary, final status\n    25→```\n    26→\n    27→## 3. Task Archival\n    28→\n    29→After agents complete:\n    30→```bash\n    31→# Update task file status to 'completed'\n    32→# Move to done/ directory\n    33→mv sessions/tasks/[priority]-[task-name].md sessions/tasks/done/\n    34→# or for directories:\n    35→mv sessions/tasks/[priority]-[task-name]/ sessions/tasks/done/\n    36→```\n    37→\n    38→## 4. Clear Task State\n    39→\n    40→```bash\n    41→# Clear task state (but keep file)\n    42→cat > .claude/state/current_task.json << 'EOF'\n    43→{\n    44→  \"task\": null,\n    45→  \"branch\": null,\n    46→  \"services\": [],\n    47→  \"updated\": \"$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\"\n    48→}\n    49→EOF\n    50→```\n    51→\n    52→## 5. Git Operations (Commit & Merge)\n    53→\n    54→### Step 1: Review Unstaged Changes\n    55→\n    56→```bash\n    57→# Check for any unstaged changes\n    58→git status\n    59→\n    60→# If changes exist, present them to user:\n    61→# \"I found the following unstaged changes: [list]\n    62→# Would you like to:\n    63→# 1.

Check the current branch name\n    71→2. Determine if this is a subtask or regular task:\n    72→   - **Subtask**: Branch name has pattern like `tt\\d+[a-z]` (e.g., tt1a, tt234b)\n    73→   - **Regular task**: Branch name like `feature/*`, `fix/*`, or `tt\\d+` (no letter)\n    74→\n    75→### Step 3: Check for Super-repo Structure\n    76→\n    77→```bash\n    78→# Check if we're in a super-repo with submodules\n    79→if [ -f .gitmodules ]; then\n    80→  echo \"Super-repo detected with submodules\"\n    81→  # Follow submodule commit ordering below\n    82→else\n    83→  echo \"Standard repository\"\n    84→  # Skip to step 4\n    85→fi\n    86→```\n    87→\n    88→### Step 4: Commit and Merge (Conditional on Structure)\n    89→\n    90→**IF SUPER-REPO**: Process from deepest submodules to super-repo\n    91→\n    92→#### A. Deepest Submodules First (Depth 2+)\n    93→For any submodules within submodules:\n    94→1. Navigate to each modified deep submodule\n    95→2. Stage changes based on user preference from Step 1\n    96→3. Commit all changes with descriptive message\n    97→4. Merge based on branch type:\n    98→   - Subtask → merge into parent task branch\n    99→   - Regular task → merge into main\n   100→5. Push the merged branch\n   101→\n   102→#### B. Direct Submodules (Depth 1)\n   103→For all modified direct submodules:\n   104→1. Navigate to each modified submodule\n   105→2. Stage changes based on user preference\n   106→3. Commit all changes with descriptive message\n   107→4. Merge based on branch type:\n   108→   - Subtask → merge into parent task branch\n   109→   - Regular task → merge into main\n   110→5. Push the merged branch\n   111→\n   112→#### C. Super-repo (Root)\n   113→After ALL submodules are committed and merged:\n   114→1. Return to super-repo root\n   115→2. Stage changes based on user preference\n   116→3. Commit all changes with descriptive message\n   117→4. Merge based on branch type:\n   118→   - Subtask → merge into parent task branch\n   119→   - Regular task → merge into main\n   120→5. Push the merged branch\n   121→\n   122→**IF STANDARD REPO**: Simple commit and merge\n   123→1. Stage changes based on user preference\n   124→2. Commit with descriptive message\n   125→3. Merge based on branch type (subtask → parent, regular → main)\n   126→4. Push the merged branch\n   127→\n   128→### Special Cases\n   129→\n   130→**Experiment branches:**\n   131→- Ask user whether to keep the experimental branch for reference\n   132→- If keeping: Just push branches without merging\n   133→- If not: Document findings first, then delete branches\n   134→\n   135→**Research tasks (no branch):**\n   136→- No merging needed\n   137→- Just ensure findings are documented in task file\n   138→\n   139→## 6. Select Next Task\n   140→\n   141→Immediately after archival:\n   142→```bash\n   143→# List all tasks (simple and reliable)\n   144→ls -la sessions/tasks/\n   145→\n   146→# Present the list to user\n   147→echo \"Task complete! Here are the remaining tasks:\"\n   148→# User can see which are .md files vs directories vs symlinks\n   149→```\n   150→\n   151→User selects next task:\n   152→- Switch to task branch: `git checkout [branch-name]`\n   153→- Update task state: Edit `.claude/state/current_task.json` with new task, branch, and services\n   154→- Follow task-startup.md protocol\n   155→\n   156→If no tasks remain:\n   157→- Celebrate completion!\n   158→- Ask user what they want to tackle next\n   159→- Create new task following task-creation.md\n   160→\n   161→## Important Notes\n   162→\n   163→- NEVER skip the agent steps - they maintain system integrity\n   164→- Task files in done/ serve as historical record\n   165→- Completed experiments should document learnings even if code is discarded\n   166→- If task is abandoned incomplete, document why in task file before archiving\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"

Main application logging setup in go/cmd/emby-analytics/main.go (lines 84-90, logger usage throughout)\n4. Environment configuration in .env.example (lines 69-79)\n\nKey aspects to review:\n- Security filtering of sensitive data (API keys, tokens, passwords)\n- Performance impact of sanitization and structured logging\n- Thread safety and concurrent usage\n- Error handling and edge cases\n- Integration with Fiber v3 middleware\n- Memory allocation patterns\n- Code maintainability and following Go best practices\n\nThe task was to replace messy ad-hoc logging with structured logging system including proper levels, context, formatting, and environment configuration while ensuring sensitive data protection."
